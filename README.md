## Implementation Details

### Data Flow Architecture

```
Market Data Sources → Ingest Service → Kafka → Processing Services → Risk Engine → Analytics
                                                  ↓
                              Limit Order Book ← Order Events → Trade Execution
                                                  ↓
                                            API Gateway → Clients

```

### Kafka Topic Design

1. **market.data.raw** - Raw market data from sources
2. **market.data.normalized** - Cleaned and normalized data
3. **orders.incoming** - New order requests
4. **orders.executed** - Completed orders
5. **risk.metrics** - Risk calculation results
6. **analytics.results** - Analysis output
